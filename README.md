## Project Overview
In this project, I will utilize classical machine learning through the scikit-learn library in Python. Coupled with dataset manipulation through pandas and data visualization through seaborn and matplotlib, I will address various supurvised and unsupurvised machine learning algorithms.

## Classification
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset) from Kaggle explores various diabetes health indicators. I then engineered a robust decision tree classifier 
model, while incorporating anomaly and outlier detection, resulting in a 95% accuracy for precise categorization of patients 
based on the severity of diabetes.

## Regression
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset) from Kaggle explores various medical and demographical data. The features include age, gender, 
body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and 
blood glucose level. I applied advanced gradient 
boosting regression, featuring meticulous hyperparameter tuning, to construct a personalized and optimized model for forecasting individualsâ€™ blood sugar levels.
